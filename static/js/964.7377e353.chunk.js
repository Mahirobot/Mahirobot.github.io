My current interest lies in the fields of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and\r\nMLOps.\r\n\r\n# Currently\r\n\r\nI am working as a Data Science and Machine Learning Engineer at [Neovotech](https://www.neovotech.com/). I am also working on making a dataset and a research paper on Automatic Recognition of Handwritten Bangla texts from images/pdfs.\r\n\r\n# Notable Works\r\n\r\n- Automatic detection and recognition of handwritten Bengali texts from images.\r\n    * At the start of this project there were no dataset for Bengali word recognition from documents. Hence, I collected 303 documents from different individuals and created a dataset of Handwritten documents for the Bengali language. \r\n    * I made an entire pipeline that takes in a document with handwritten paragraph in Bengali, and returns digitized text of the document. The pipeline consists of, image pre-processing, line segmentation, removal of overlapping lines, word detection and finally word recognition. The recognition accuracy was 76% at that time.\r\n\r\n- [Learning without Forgetting for 3D Point Cloud Objects](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.14275v1.pdf). \r\n    * In this paper we mainly experimented learning without forgetting on 3D point clouds and knowledge distillation with semantic vectors to minimize the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting.\r\n    * My main contribution was experimenting with 2D images and testing the 3D models. \r\n\r\n- A pipepline for automatic OMR and OCR from OMR sheets\r\n    * This was a product made for a school where a scanned OMR sheet was provided as an input and the OMR and OCR of the handwritten marks was returned as an output.\r\n    * My main contribution was creating the OCR part along with the pipeline, integrating the OMR part, creating custom dataset, image pre-processing, page alignment, testing and setting up connection with mqtt.\r\n\r\n# I dream of\r\n\r\n- getting a PHD in data science\r\n- contributing and making an impact  \r\n- helping people through my work\r\n\r\n# Websites from people I admire\r\n\r\n- [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/courses/)\r\n\r\n",g=d.split(/\s+/).map((function(n){return n.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(n){return n.length})).length,h=function(n){var e=Object.assign({},n);return(0,c.jsx)(i.rU,(0,a.Z)({},e))};e.default=function(){return(0,c.jsx)(s.Z,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Mahira Jalisha",children:(0,c.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[(0,c.jsx)("header",{children:(0,c.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[(0,c.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:(0,c.jsx)(i.rU,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),(0,c.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",g," words)"]})]})}),(0,c.jsx)(o(),{source:d,renderers:{Link:h},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
