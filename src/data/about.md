# Intro

I am a data science enthusiast and an aspiring machine learning practitioner with core interest in deep learning. My current interest lies in the fields of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and
MLOps.

# Currently

I am working as a Data Science and Machine Learning Engineer at [Neovotech](https://www.neovotech.com/). I am also working on making a dataset and a research paper on Automatic Recognition of Handwritten Bangla texts from images/pdfs.

# Notable Works

- Automatic detection and recognition of handwritten Bengali texts from images.
    * At the start of this project there were no dataset for Bengali word recognition from documents. Hence, I collected 303 documents from different individuals and created a dataset of Handwritten documents for the Bengali language. 
    * I made an entire pipeline that takes in a document with handwritten paragraph in Bengali, and returns digitized text of the document. The pipeline consists of, image pre-processing, line segmentation, removal of overlapping lines, word detection and finally word recognition. The recognition accuracy was 76% at that time.

- [Learning without Forgetting for 3D Point Cloud Objects](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.14275v1.pdf). 
    * In this paper we mainly experimented learning without forgetting on 3D point clouds and knowledge distillation with semantic vectors to minimize the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting.
    * My main contribution was experimenting with 2D images and testing the 3D models. 

- A pipepline for automatic OMR and OCR from OMR sheets
    * This was a product made for a school where a scanned OMR sheet was provided as an input and the OMR and OCR of the handwritten marks was returned as an output.
    * My main contribution was creating the OCR part along with the pipeline, integrating the OMR part, creating custom dataset, image pre-processing, page alignment, testing and setting up connection with mqtt.
